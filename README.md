# Rocket Landing Game (3D Unity Project)

A 3D rocket landing simulation game built with Unity. The player controls a small rocket and attempts to land it safely on various platforms across challenging alien terrains. This project focuses on physics-based movement, smooth camera transitions, and stylized low-poly art.

## Gameplay Overview

- Control a rocket using thrust and directional movement.
- Land on pads to complete levels.
- Navigate obstacles like rocks, mechanical arms, and tricky terrain.
- Realistic gravity and momentum-based gameplay.
